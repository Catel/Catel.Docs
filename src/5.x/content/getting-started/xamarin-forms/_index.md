Welcome to the *Getting started* guide for Catel and Xamarin.Forms. In this guide, a very simple application will be created with the most commonly used aspects of Catel and Xamarin.Forms.

Note that this guide assumes that the reader has a basic understanding of XAML and Xamarin.Forms since this guide will not cover these basics

The source code for this example can be found at <https://github.com/Catel/Catel.GettingStarted.Xamarin.Forms>

Note that this guide will recommend code snippets that can be found [here](http://www.catelproject.com/downloads/general-files/). They are not required, just recommended to speed up creating Catel classes and properties.
