Behaviors and triggers are very important to correctly separate the view from the view model. For example, to respond to an event in a view model, you cannot simply subscribe to the events in the view. The EventToCommand behavior is a great example to solve this problem.

Catel offers lots of behaviors out of the box, so it is definitely worth taking a look at the behaviors.

## Managing interactivity classes

Starting with Catel 4.0, it is possible to manage interactivity classes such as behaviors from the InteractivityManager class. This allows a developer to get notified when a behavior or trigger is loaded or unloaded.

{{% notice warning %}}
Note that the *InteractivityManager* is only compatible with behaviors and triggers using one of the Catel base classes
{{% /notice %}}

The manager contains both events and methods to retrieve information about triggers. For example, if one is interested in all the *Focus* triggers, one could do the following:

```
public class FocusWatcher
{
    private static readonly ILog Log = LogManager.GetCurrentClassLogger();
 
    private readonly IInteractivityManager _interactivityManager;

    public FocusWatcher(IInteractivityManager interactivityManager)
    {
        Argument.IsNotNull(() => interactivityManager);

        _interactivityManager = interactivityManager;
        _interactivityManager.BehaviorLoaded += OnBehaviorLoaded;
        _interactivityManager.BehaviorUnloaded += OnBehaviorUnloaded;
    }

    private void OnBehaviorLoaded(object sender, BehaviorEventArgs e)
    {
        var focus = e.Behavior as Focus;
        if (focus != null)
        {
            Log.Info("Focus behavior loaded");
        }
    }

    private void OnBehaviorUnloaded(object sender, BehaviorEventArgs e)
    {
        var focus = e.Behavior as Focus;
        if (focus != null)
        {
            Log.Info("Focus behavior unloaded");
        }
    }
}
```
