The `IViewLocator` class is responsible for resolving the right views for a view model. Before Catel 3.0, the `IUIVisualizerService` was responsible for resolving the view, but this responsibility is now taken over by the `IViewLocator`. The `UIVisualizerService` internally uses the `IViewLocator` to resolve the views.Â 

## Resolving by naming convention

It is possible to resolve views using the `IViewLocator`. Then you can use the `ResolveView` method to resolve the view based on the type of the view model.

For example, the following view model:

```
Catel.Examples.ViewModels.MyViewModel
```

will be resolved as:

```
Catel.Examples.Views.MyView
```

## Manually resolving a view using naming convention

To manually resolve a view using naming convention, use the following code:

```
var viewLocator = ServiceLocator.Default.ResolveType<IViewLocator>();
var viewType = viewLocator.ResolveView(typeof(MyViewModel));
```

## Customizing naming conventions

By default, the `IViewLocator` uses the following naming conventions to resolve views:

-   [UP].Views.[VM]
-   [UP].Views.[VM]View
-   [UP].Views.[VM]Control
-   [UP].Views.[VM]Window
-   [UP].Views.[VM]Page
-   [UP].Views.[VM]Activity
-   [UP].Views.[VM]Fragment
-   [UP].Controls.[VM]
-   [UP].Controls.[VM]Control
-   [UP].Pages.[VM]
-   [UP].Pages.[VM]Page
-   [UP].Windows.[VM]
-   [UP].Windows.[VM]Window
-   [AS].Views.[VM]
-   [AS].Views.[VM]View
-   [AS].Views.[VM]Control
-   [AS].Views.[VM]Page
-   [AS].Views.[VM]Window
-   [AS].Views.[VM]Activity
-   [AS].Views.[VM]Fragment
-   [AS].Controls.[VM]
-   [AS].Controls.[VM]Control
-   [AS].Pages.[VM]
-   [AS].Pages.[VM]Page
-   [AS].Windows.[VM]
-   [AS].Windows.[VM]Window
-   [AS].Activities.[VM]
-   [AS].Activities.[VM]Activity
-   [AS].Fragments.[VM]
-   [AS].Fragments.[VM]Fragment
-   [AS].UI.Views.[VM]
-   [AS].UI.Views.[VM]View
-   [AS].UI.Views.[VM]Control
-   [AS].UI.Views.[VM]Page
-   [AS].UI.Views.[VM]Window
-   [AS].UI.Views.[VM]Activity
-   [AS].UI.Views.[VM]Fragment
-   [AS].UI.Controls.[VM]
-   [AS].UI.Controls.[VM]Control
-   [AS].UI.Pages.[VM]
-   [AS].UI.Pages.[VM]Page
-   [AS].UI.Windows.[VM]
-   [AS].UI.Windows.[VM]Window
-   [AS].UI.Activities.[VM]
-   [AS].UI.Activities.[VM]Activity
-   [AS].UI.Activities.[VM]Fragment
-   [CURRENT].[VM]View
-   [CURRENT].[VM]Control
-   [CURRENT].[VM]Page
-   [CURRENT].[VM]Window
-   [CURRENT].[VM]Activity
-   [CURRENT].[VM]Fragment

However, it is possible to add or remove new naming conventions to support your own naming convention. For example, to add a new naming convention for a different assembly, use this code:

```
var viewLocator = ServiceLocator.Default.ResolveType<IViewLocator>();
viewLocator.NamingConventions.Add("MyCustomAssembly.Views.[VM]View");
```

## Registering custom views

Sometimes, a class doesn't follow a naming convention (for whatever reason possible). In such a case, it is possible to register a mapping manually using the following code:

```
var viewLocator = ServiceLocator.Default.ResolveType<IViewLocator>();
viewLocator.Register(typeof(MyViewModelNotFollowingNamingConvention), typeof(MyView));
```

## Using a custom ViewLocator

If you want to have total freedom to determine which view is provided per view model (maybe there are other services that have an impact on this), it is possible to create a custom `IViewLocator` implementation. Then the only thing to do is to register it using the following code:

```
ServiceLocator.Default.RegisterType<IViewLocator, MyViewLocator>();
```
