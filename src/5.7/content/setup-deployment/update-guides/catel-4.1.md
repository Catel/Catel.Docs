## IUIVisualizerService

We have reverted the change to force you to use async code on the *IUIVisualizerService*. There are now 2 options:

1.  Synchronous:

    ```
    var result = uiVisualizerService.ShowDialog<MyViewModel>();
     
    // Window is closed here (synchronous behavior)
    ```

2.  Asynchronous:

    ```
    var result = await uiVisualizerService.ShowDialogAsync<MyViewModel>();
     
    // Window is closed here thanks to the await keyword
    ```
