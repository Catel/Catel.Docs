# Introduction to customizing serialization

## The serialization engine explained

All classes deriving from `ModelBase` use the serialization engine of Catel to serialize itself in a whole or as a subset of properties. Below is a schema which sheds some light on the architecture.

The `SerializerBase` now contains all the serialization and deserialization logic. The advantage is that this logic is no longer contained by the `ModelBase` itself which makes the class much simpler to understand and maintain. Now the `SerializerBase` contains all the heavy lifting, the deriving classes (`XmlSerializer` and `BinarySerializer`) only have to implement a few methods.

The serialization process works as shown in the diagram below:
