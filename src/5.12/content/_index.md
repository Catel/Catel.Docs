### Models

This model has automatic change notifications and validation.

```
public class Person : ValidatableModelBase
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }

    public string LastName { get; set; }

    protected override void ValidateFields(List<IFieldValidationResult> validationResults)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrWhitespace(FirstName))
        {
            validationResults.Add(FieldValidationResult.CreateError(nameof(FirstName), "First name is required"));
        }

        if (string.IsNullOrWhitespace(LastName))
        {
            validationResults.Add(FieldValidationResult.CreateError(nameof(LastName), "Last name is required"));
        }
    }    
}
```

### View models

This is a view model with:

- Automatic injection of the DataContext
- Automatic mapping of properties & validation from model => view model

```
public class PersonViewModel : ViewModelBase
{
    public PersonViewModel(Person person)
    {
        Argument.IsNotNull(() => person);

        Person = person;
    }

    [Model]
    private Person Person { get; set; }

    [ViewModelToModel]
    public string FirstName { get; set; }

    [ViewModelToModel]
    public string LastName { get; set; }
