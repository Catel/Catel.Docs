## Fundamental differences

There are some fundamental differences between platforms (such as Xaml and Android). The table below explains the differences so it is easy to understand for a developer what to use when. Note that all services are defined by interfaces and can be used on all the platforms in the same manner. The platform-specific implementations are hidden as much as possible to keep the view models very re-usable.
