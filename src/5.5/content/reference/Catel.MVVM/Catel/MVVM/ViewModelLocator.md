Resolver that will resolve view model types based on the view type. For example, if a view with the type name`MyAssembly.Views.PersonView` is inserted, this could result in the view model type`MyAssembly.ViewModels.PersonViewModel`.

## Methods

### GetDefaultNamingConventions()

Gets the default naming conventions.

#### Returns

An enumerable of default naming conventions.

### IsCompatible(Type viewType, Type viewModelType)

Determines whether the specified view type is compatible with the view model. A view is compatible if it's either resolved via naming conventions or registered manually.

`true` if the view is compatible with the view model; otherwise,`false`.

#### Parameters

### ResolveNamingConvention(string assembly, string typeToResolveName, string namingConvention)

#### Parameters

Name|Description
---|---
**assembly**|The assembly name.
**typeToResolveName**|The full type name of the type to resolve.
**namingConvention**|The naming convention to use for resolving.

The resolved naming convention.

Resolves a view model type by the view and the registered NamingConventions.

#### Parameters

The resolved view model or`null` if the view model could not be resolved.
