Initializes a new instance of the [Activity](#) class.

## Properties

### DataContext

Gets or sets the data context.

### IsEnabled

Gets or sets a value indicating whether the view is enabled.

## Events

This event makes it possible to externally subscribe to property changes of a view (mostly the container of a view model) because the .NET Framework does not allows us to.

### ViewModelChanged

Occurs when the ViewModel property has changed.

### ViewModelPropertyChanged

Occurs when a property on the ViewModel has changed.
