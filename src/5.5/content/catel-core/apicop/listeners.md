Listeners are a way to get information about the cops and their rules in the framework. The *ApiCopManager* will take care of all the retrieval of the results and the registration of the cops. The registered listeners are used by the *ApiCopManager.WriteResults* method to write the output to. To add a listener and be able to see the output of the *ApiCop* feature, use the following code:

```
var apiCopListener = new ConsoleApiCopListener();
ApiCopManager.AddListener(apiCopListener);
```

After the listeners are added, one can call *ApiCopManager.WriteResults*:

```
ApiCopManager.WriteResults();
```

## Customizing grouping

It is possible to group the listeners. To specify the grouping, use the following code:

```
var apiCopListener = new ConsoleApiCopListener();
apiCopListener.Grouping = ApiCopListenerGrouping.Rule;
```

The following grouping options are available:

Grouping name|Description
-|-
Cop|Sort by the name of the class in which the cop is registered.
Rule|Sort by the rule name.
Tag|Sort by tag, which is dependent on the rule implementation. It is recommended though to use the final class name as tag.

## Creating custom listeners

Catel provides several listeners out of the box. To create custom listeners, the only requirement is to implement the *IApiCopListener*. To make it easier to create custom listeners (such as an HTML listener), Catel provides the following base classes which can also be used as a base for custom listeners:

-   *ApiCopListenerBase*
    Gives most flexibility, but is also more work to implement 
-   *TextApiCopListenerBase*
    Is fully prepared for all text-based listeners (such as console, text file, etc), and only requires the implementation of the *WriteLine* method
