**Base types**
[Behavior]({{< relref "#" >}})

**Implements interfaces**
[IBehavior]({{< relref "reference/Catel.MVVM/Catel/Windows/Interactivity/IBehavior.md" >}})

Behavior base class that handles a safe unsubscribe and clean up because the default behavior class does not always call`OnDetaching`. This class also adds some specific features such as ValidateRequiredProperties which is automatically called when the behavior is attached.

#### Type Parameters

**T**
The [IView](#) this behavior should attach to.

## Fields

### IsEnabledProperty

The IsEnabled property registration.

## Properties

### Culture

Gets the culture.

### IsAssociatedObjectLoaded

Gets a value indicating whether the is loaded.

### IsEnabled

Gets or sets a value indicating whether this behavior is enabled.

### IsInDesignMode

Gets a value indicating whether this instance is in design mode.

## Methods

### Initialize()

Initializes the behavior. This method is called instead of the OnAttached which is sealed to protect the additional behavior.

### OnAssociatedObjectLoaded()

Called when the AssociatedObject is loaded.

### OnAssociatedObjectUnloaded()

Called when the AssociatedObject is unloaded.

### OnAttached()

Called after the behavior is attached to an AssociatedObject.

### OnDetaching()

Called when the behavior is being detached from its AssociatedObject, but before it has actually occurred.

### OnIsEnabledChanged()

Called when the IsEnabled property has changed.

### Uninitialize()

Uninitializes the behavior. This method is called when OnDetaching is called, or when the is unloaded. If dependency properties are used, it is very important to use to clear the value of the dependency properties in this method.

### ValidateRequiredProperties()

Validates the required properties. This method is called when the object is attached, but before the Initialize is invoked.
