# Commands

Commands are supported in Catel. The base class for commands is *Command*.

## Code snippets

-   vmcommand - declare a command on a view model
-   vmcommandwithcanexecute - declare a command with support for CanExecute on a view model

## Explanation

To implement commands, and still be able to unit test the view models, a separate command is introduced. This command allows a developer to implement a command that can be invoked both via code (unit testing) and UI.

There is one real *Command* class: *Command\<TCanExecuteParameter, TExecuteParameter\>*

The *TCanExecuteParameter* is the parameter that is passed to the *CanExecute* of the command, ands saves the developer from casting the object (as in the interface *ICommand* to a typed object). The same goes for *TExecuteParameter* which makes the *Execute* of the command typed.

There are also several wrappers available in case object is used as type parameter:

-   *Command\<TExecuteParameter\>* (wraps *Command\<TCanExecuteParameter, TExecuteParameter\>* with object for *TCanExecuteParameter*)
-   *Command* (wraps *Command\<TExecuteParameter\>* with object for *TExecuteParameter*)

## Examples

Code:

```
private readonly IMessageService _messageService;
 
public void MyViewModel(IMessageService messageService)
{
    Argument.IsNotNull(() => messageService);
 
    _messageService = messageService;
    // Add commands
    MyAction = new Command(MyAction_Execute);
}

/// <summary>
/// Gets the MyAction command.
/// </summary>
public Command MyAction { get; private set; }

/// <summary>
/// Method to invoke when the MyAction command is executed.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="parameter">The parameter of the command.</param>
private void MyAction_Execute(object parameter)
{
    // Show message box
    _messageService.ShowInfo("My action in MVVM");
}
```

Xaml (assuming that the view model is set as datacontext):

```
<Button Content="Click me" Command="{Binding MyCommand}" />
```
