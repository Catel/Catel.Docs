# Getting a summary of validation results

Sometimes you just need to get a summary of all warnings and errors of an object. All validation is gathered in the IValidationContext and available on that class. However, there are some convenience classes that allow a developer to create a summary based on a specific tag. This convenience class is IValidationSummary, which gathers the right information from an instance of IValidationContext.

## Creating a summary of all validations

 To retrieve a summary of all validations from a IValidationContext, use the following code:

```
var validationSummary = validationContext.GetValidationSummary();
```

## Creating a summary of all validations with a specific tag

To retrieve a summary of all validations with a specific tag from a IValidationContext, use the following code:

```
var validationSummary = validationContext.GetValidationSummary("tag");
```

## Using the ValidationToViewModel attribute

The ValidationToViewModel attribute allows a developer to gather a summary of an object easily. For example, to get all the person related validation into the *PersonValidationSummary* property, use the property definition below:

```
[ValidationToViewModel(Tag = "PersonValidation")]
public IValidationSummary PersonValidationSummary { get; set; }
```

All validation results that have the tag *PersonValidation* will automatically be gathered into the *PersonValidationSummary* property after each validation sequence.
