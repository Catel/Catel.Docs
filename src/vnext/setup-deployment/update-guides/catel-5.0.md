## Catel.Core

### CommandLineHelper

`CommandLineHelper` has been removed. Use [Orc.CommandLine](https://github.com/wildgums/orc.commandline) instead.

### DynamicEventListener

`DynamicEventListener` has been removed. Use `WeakEventListener` instead.

### ModelBase

The `ModelBase` has been greatly simplified to decrease the memory print and improve performance. The class is split up into separate classes:

- ModelBase => takes care of basic serialization and property bag registrations
- ValidatableModelBase => adds validation
- ChildAwareModelBase => contains the child event subscriptions logic (which is very costly)
- SavableModelBase => adds `Save` and `Load` methods 
- ComparableModelBase => contains the equality comparer members. This means the `ModelBase` itself does no longer support equality checks based on the property values

## Catel.MVVM

### CountCollapsedConverter

`CountCollapsedConverter` has been removed. Use `CollectionToVisibilityConverter` instead.

### EffectsHelper

`EffectsHelper` has been removed. No replacement is available.

### ViewModelBase

The `ViewModelBase` has been simplified. It now derives from `ValidatingModelBase` (so still supports validation). The following features / members have been removed:

* `HasDirtyModels` has been removed
* Validation summaries (use the `ValidationContext` instead)

### VisualTargetPresentationSource

`VisualTargetPresentationSource` has been removed. No replacement is available.
