```
public interface INeedCustomInitialization
```

Interface that defines that a type needs initialization after it has been created by the [TypeFactory](#). As soon as a type is created, the [TypeFactory](#) will check whether it implements the [INeedCustomInitialization](#) interface. If so, it will call the Initialize method. It is best to explicitly implement this interface to prevent misuse.

## Methods

### Initialize()

Initializes this instance.
