      <description>Lots of developers are using designers such as the built-in designer in Visual Studio or Expression Blend to design their xaml based applications. Although you should use designers with lots of care, we strive to fully support all designers.
Since Catel 1.3, it is possible to create design-time versions of a view model. This way, you can preview the UserControl or DataWindow implementations using example data.
To create design-time support for a data window, use the following steps:</description>

      <description>Sometimes one needs to run code during design-time. A good example is to register a custom LanguageResourceSource in the LanguageService to show translations in the designer. Unfortunately it is not as easy as putting some code in the code-behind to get this working.
Starting with Catel 4.3, calling CatelEnvironment.IsInDesignTime will automatically invoke DesignTimeHelper.InitializeDesignTime if in design mode. This means you only have to add classes deriving from DesignTimeInitializer and they will automatically be invoked when any code is checking if it&amp;rsquo;s currently running inside a designer context (e.</description>
