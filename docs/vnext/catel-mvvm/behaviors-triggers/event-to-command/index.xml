However many implementations of the behavior come with the caveat, they cause a ViewModel to have knowledge of View specific types as well as causing a ViewModel to be directly dependent on the View.
To resolve that concern, Catel provides support for an EventArgsConverter that can be attached to an EventToCommand binding.</description></item></channel></rss>
